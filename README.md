# Data Trees
A data tree built in Python. The program generates a tree with a random number of nodes and contents (either 1 or 0) and produces the sum of its node data, how many nodes it containts, and how many non-empty universal trees it has. A non-empty universal tree is a tree with at least one node where every node has the same data.
